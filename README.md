Introduction 

Welcome to Cafe Koji, a heartwarming simulator where your dream of running a cozy café comes to life. Set in the picturesque town of Yamoka, you arrive as a newcomer with a passion for coffee, a love for pastries, and a knack for bringing people together. The townsfolk are eager to meet you, each with their own unique stories to share. 

As you explore Yamoka, chatting with friendly NPCs and gathering resources, you'll uncover the hidden charm of this serene town. The café you build isn’t just any café—there’s something about it that feels different, almost as if it carries a quiet anticipation. What starts as a simple venture may eventually lead you to moments of surprise and challenge, where the unexpected could change everything. 

Are you ready to create a café that serves more than just coffee and pastries? Your adventure begins now, and it's bound to be more than you ever imagined.
